Throughout the year, migratory birds cross
countries and continents, some of them 
from the tundra to the tropics, covering hundreds
or even thousands of miles linking different ecosystems.
So our project will help to find out the species of birds
that are getting endangered so that we and our government
can make some extra efforts to prevent the birds and 
our ecosystem.

2D Speed Vs Frequency
Data for our project will be taken from  
LifeWatch INBO project
techniques or Libraries that I will use for this are 
Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy
We will load bird data for any gull into some variable 
and speed data of
the same gull into any other variable
We will plot a 8 x 4 figure and allot isnan speed data
We will find out the count of
non numeric entries.
After that we will plot a histogram using the hist() function.


Matplotlib for potting graphs
Pandas for data analysis
